# Automated Math Tutor

Welcome to my Senior Comprehensive Project Repository!

## Project Description
This Project is a java program designed to help tutor students on determing the inverse of operations, and applying that in solving an equation for a single variable. This project was done in Java, and completed with the implemntation of various data structure. The basis of this project was first finding a way to create a math an equation solver. This can be done a number of ways, using brute force, machine learning, or calling to another program. However this project created its equation solver using an expression tree, and creating a number of functions to solve the tree while still obeying the laws of mathematics. This program was desined to help students learn how to solve equations, and it does that by providing postive feed back and guidance while also taking in user inputs during each step of the solution. 

## How to Install and Run this Project
Firstly this program is one java file, with the various classes already added in, to make running a little easier. This prgram was designed to run in terminal, it does not have a designated interface. 


What that being said there are three ways to run this program:  

1. In terminal 

To run in terminal refer to this website with help [Java in Terminal Instructions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/How-to-run-a-java-program)

The ExpressionTree.java file is the only file needed to run the program, so download it to your computer. 

Change directory to the location of the file. The compile the java file in terminal with with `javac ExpressionTree.java` then to run the java file `java ExpresisonTree` the result should begin printing to your window.

2. In an Java IDE software online such as IntelliJ, or X code

To run in a Java IDE, simply add the ExpressionTree.java file to the src folder of a project.

3. You can use an online java compiler to save the hassle of checking if you have java installed on your computer.

One online java compiler that can be used is [Online Java Compiler](https://www.online-java.com/)

## How to Use the Project
This project begins by providing instructions on what type of equations to input, linear single variable equations, and then asks for the user to input the variable they would like to solve for. 

From there if the equation is valid the program will begin to run, asking the user for what the inverse of certain operations are corresponding to the operands that are being moved to work towards a solution. 

At each the step the program will ask the user when they are ready to recieve the answer at each step, and ready to move onto the next until the program is done running. 

## User Testing and Feedback 

In a file called UserTestingProblemSet I have added the problem set I gave all of my testers, and the data collected from their feedback form is in a file called FeedbackFormResults.
